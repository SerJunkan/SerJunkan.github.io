        <h1>HTML Analysis</h1>
        <p>
        Note:This section of this site is sadly not dedicated to Prussia, however it is instead dedicated to the review of a good HTML and 
        a bad HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
        Well for a start i will be comparing 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
        VS.
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>,
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
        being the bad one and 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
        being the good one.
        </p>
        <p>
        Well Why do i consider 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
        to be bad and 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
        to be good? 
        well for a start 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
         is the most digusting piece of HTML garbage as it contains all things that make a html bad, such as 
        flashy colors, many diffrent designs and not at all user friendly. compare that to 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
         and you have yourself a simple non flashy 
        simple site designed to entertain people and establish contact between 2 or more people (such is the magic of social media). 
        However 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a> 
        could be considered as a good site as it is designed to give the example of what a bad html is and therefore could 
        technically be better than 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
         but i disagree as the bare sight of 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a> 
        almost made me wanna womit in disgust. 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a> 
        also has alot more to offer then 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
        , such as endless set of quality images and an already set userbase. 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a> 
        also does a great job at of horribly leaking images out of frame, supposedly becouse they messed something up with
        the box model. Compare that to 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
         wich uses its box models in a "smooth" way making the user feel comfy when scrollin up and
        down the vebsite. At last the locatsion each site puts it links on is either horrible or pretty good, for example on 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
        the links are placed all over the place and sometimes dont even work correctly, while 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
         always keep they're most important
        links at the top so the user can get to it whenever he wants to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
        I personally Consider all this (plus some more) this to be a solid reason why 
        <a href="https://badhtml.com/">Site 1</a>
         is horrible and 
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Site 2</a>
          pretty good.
